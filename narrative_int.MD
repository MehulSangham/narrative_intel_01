Narrative Intelligence

In a time of cotnested truht, we help you see the signal in the noise. 


Narrative Intelligence is a consultancy focused on data, knowledge and meaning.
We provide narrative analysis, forecasting, and knowledge infrastructure services that help purpose driven organizations see the signal in the noise and act where it matters.

We build the semantic intelligence layer for organizations working at the edge of culture, policy, and systems transformation. 
In an age of contested truths, we help you map meaning, trace power, and intervene with precision.

We are a strategic insight partner for mission-driven organizations.

Our tools decode cultural language, our machine-learning models forecast narrative shifts, and our organizational practices build the inner knowledge capacity you need to turn insight into aligned, purposeful action.

What is Narrative Intelligence (nIQ)? 
Narrative Intelligence is the capacity to understand and work with the deep structure of any system, whether it be social, political, technological, or ecological. This deep structure discloses how this system makes meaning and enacts purpose within the world. 
At its core, nIQ reveals what artificial and organic intelligences have in common: they both emerge from an information space shaped by meaning and purpose. This semantic space defines how a system perceives, organizes, and responds to its environment.
By mapping this ‘meaning-space’ we make visible the underlying patterns, potentials, and weakness of the system itself. Narrative Intelligence allows us to move beyond data and into the logic of system-level sensemaking: how meaning is constructed, how it spreads, and how it changes over time.
Through this we allow the system to see itself, and develop coherent and effective strategies for evolution. 
Through this lens, nIQ becomes a powerful pathway for developing knowledge capacities that support adaptive, strategic, and system-aware action.

1. nIQ Audit: Measuring Your Narrative Intelligence  
At its core, nIQ is the capacity of an organization to process, structure, and act on signals from its environment and, through this,  create meaningful and measurable change. It is a measurable and improvable faculty, one that lives across systems: in how data is gathered, how knowledge flows internally, and how the organization communicates with the world. 

When nIQ is low, the organization lacks the knowledge architecture to know how and when to act effetcively. 

The nIQ Audit is a one-month engagement designed to assess and strengthen this capacity. It offers a clear answer to a deceptively simple question: How intelligent is your organization in the way it uses data, information and knowledge?


The output of the audit is both diagnostic and generative. You’ll receive a comprehensive report outlining areas of narrative coherence and fragmentation, a baseline nIQ score that can evolve over time, and a custom framework for building semantic alignment across teams and functions. 
Outcome

The outcome of the nIQ Audit is a step-change in how your organization understands itself. You gain a high-resolution view of your current semantic ecosystem—how meaning is being created, lost, or misaligned across teams, data, and public engagement.

2. Narrative Mapping & Strategic Insight
This three-month engagement is designed for organizations that want to integrate narrative intelligence into their strategic operations. It provides sustained, high-touch support in identifying relevant meaning-rich data, generating deep insights, and translating those insights into action.

Where the nIQ Audit offers diagnosis, this  builds a live capacity for narrative foresight and intervention. It helps your organization move from isolated signals and intuition to structured sense-making, focused response, and measurable influence.

The process begins with a half-day workshop focused on point-of-view development. Together, we clarify your strategic goals, narrative terrain, and the kinds of meaning-signals that matter most to your mission.

From there, we build a bespoke narrative sensing architecture: a lightweight structure for capturing relevant public, sectoral, and internal data sources, and analyzing them through a semantic and strategic lens.
Outputs
Throughout the three months, we provide:

Biweekly Narrative Briefings: synthesized insight reports tracking emergent metaphors, discursive shifts, and strategic openings 

Data Support & Advisory: help with identifying and integrating the correct internal or public data to support specific initiatives or hypotheses 

Strategic Intervention Design: support in developing communication or narrative-based interventions grounded in the insights we surface 

Impact Monitoring Framework: guidance on how to assess narrative traction and build a lightweight semantic M&E system to track evolving impact
Outcome
To support this process, we use a range of advanced data analytics and machine learning tools to collect, process, and interpret narrative data at scale. This includes natural language processing (NLP), semantic clustering, metaphor and frame detection, and the construction of knowledge graphs and neural networks. 

These tools ensure that your insights are not only grounded in context but also robust across large and diverse data environments.

We act as your thinking partner and narrative intelligence team, embedded within your existing workflow.

3. Building nIQ Capacity
The is a deep, cohort-based program designed to embed narrative intelligence into the core of your organization.

Over the course of 6–10 months, a selected team  participates in a structured learning process that combines theory, practical tools, and live application.

 The goal is to develop a distributed capacity for semantic awareness, strategic sense-making, and adaptive narrative response across your organization.

This is not a course. It is a transformational process that combines curriculum, organizational design, and systems implementation. The result is a team that can perceive meaning systems, act within them, and shape the conditions for strategic coherence and collective purpose.
1. Curriculum & Training

Participants engage in a structured, cohort-based learning journey designed to develop practical, strategic narrative intelligence within the organization.

The curriculum is delivered through monthly live learning sessions, supported by curated readings, custom toolkits, and guided application exercises. Each module builds foundational knowledge and applies it to real-world organizational challenges
Key areas of focus include:

Understanding Narrative Intelligence: What narrative intelligence is, how it functions within systems, and why meaning is key to adaptive strategy.


Working with Meaningful Language: How metaphors, frames, and story structures shape thought, behavior, and public perception both internally and externally.


Narrative Sensing & Interpretation: How to identify meaningful signals from media, public discourse, and organizational communication, and translate them into insight.


Tracking What Matters:  What types of narrative data are most relevant to your mission, how to structure them, and how to integrate them with strategic decision-making.


Designing for Impact: How to design narrative interventions—messaging, campaigns, positioning—that are coherent, adaptive, and aligned with purpose.
Ongoing Practice & Integration

Participants apply what they learn through:

Real-time projects embedded in their day-to-day work
Biweekly narrative insight sessions to practice framing, pattern analysis, and interpretation
Shared sense-making circles to develop collective narrative reflexes
Structured feedback loops to build alignment across teams and initiatives

This practice-oriented model ensures that learning isn’t abstract, but becomes embodied and applied across functions.
 Narrative Tools & Infrastructure


As the cohort develops, we work alongside your technical and strategic teams to: 
Design semantic data pipelines tailored to your needs 
Integrate lightweight narrative tools (dashboards, ontologies, insight briefings) 
Build internal workflows for managing and acting on meaning-rich data 
Develop a Narrative Intelligence Playbook and a sustainable capacity roadmap.
Outputs
A trained cohort of certified narrative practitioners with a shared conceptual foundation
A live narrative intelligence system embedded in organizational strategy and operations
Custom-built tools and workflows to support ongoing narrative sensing and intervention
Organizational sense-making practices aligned with your purpose and field
A culture of reflexive meaning-making that improves coordination, clarity, and action
Outcomes
At the end of the fellowship, your organization will hold an innate capacity for narrative intelligence: distributed across key teams, embedded in practice, and guided by integrated knowledge infrastructure.
You will be equipped to:
Perceive and respond to narrative shifts in real time
Align data, communication, and decision-making through a shared semantic lens
Build coherence between vision, voice, and action
Operate with strategic adaptability in complex and contested environments
